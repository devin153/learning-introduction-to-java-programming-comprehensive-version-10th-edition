		 * whether the difference of the two numbers is less than some threshold. 
		 * That is, two numbers x and y are very close if |xâˆ’y| < EPSILON for a very 
		 * small value, EPSILON. EPSILON, a Greek letter pronounced epsilon, is commonly 
		 * used to denote a very small value. Normally, you set e to 10^-14 for comparing two
		 * values of the double type and to 10^-7 for comparing two values of the float type.
